Topic: Improving Education in NJ Grade Schools with Digital Application

Educational Data Mining (EDM) is an emerging field of Data mining where Machine Learning and AI tools can add much value by analyzing vast amounts of data generated from educational settings to uncover important patterns in student’s learning behavior, effectiveness of different technology and learning tools and impact of demographic and other parameters on educational outcomes. The aim of our project is to use EDM to lay the groundwork for Aviv Learning, a new education company, to build an interactive digital application that can help students of New Jersey (NJ) K-12 public schools improve their performance on standardized tests. For this pilot study we plan to make use of NJ's 2016-17 public school performance report to answer the following questions:

A) What regions/ school districts in NJ are “underperforming”? (my part)
B) What subjects and grade levels are most in need of improvement?
C) What are the underlying reasons for variation in distribution of funds across districts and whether there is any meaningful distinction between “Charter Schools” vs “Non-Charter Schools”?
